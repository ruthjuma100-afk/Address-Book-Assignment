## Project Name

**Address Book Application**
---
### Project Description

The Address Book Application is a simple web-based project that allows users to add, view, and manage contacts. Each contact includes a full name, phone number, and email address.
The project uses JavaScript constructor functions and prototypes for business logic and applies Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure the logic works correctly. Contacts can be displayed dynamically on the page and persisted using localStorage.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. Tests are written before implementing the business logic

2. A minimal custom testing helper is used instead of external libraries

3. Tests validate:

- Proper initialization of the Address Book

- Correct handling of contacts

4. Test results are displayed in the browser console using clear pass/fail messages

- Example test output:

✅ AddressBook initializes with empty contacts

❌ Contact should be added to the list

### Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the application

CSS – Styling and layout of the user interface

JavaScript – Application logic and interactivity

LocalStorage – Persistent storage of contacts

Vanilla JS Prototypes & Constructors – Business logic design

Console-based Testing – Test-Driven Development (TDD)
